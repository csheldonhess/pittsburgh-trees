Pittsburgh's Trees
==================

Using data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, I made a map of the trees maintained by the City of Pittsburgh's Department of Public Works Forestry Division. I want to look at income data for various neighborhoods to get a sense of whether DPW is planting trees "fairly" across all socioeconomic sectors. I'd also like to look at whether trees suitable for providing food are planted in local food deserts. 

* [A map of all of the trees, unfiltered](https://parodybit.carto.com/builder/7908a080-5345-11e6-b0c5-0e3ebc282e83/embed) - This also shows "wooded areas" in Allegheny County.

Data sets I have used or will be using:
* [City of Pittsburgh Trees](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees) - in the map above
* [Allegheny County Wooded Area Boundaries](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-wooded-area-boundaries) - in the map above
* [Pittsburgh SNAP Census Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pgh) - for characterizing areas of the city by socioeconomic status
* [Falling Fruit's list of edible plants](https://fallingfruit.org/data?c=forager%2Cfreegan&locale=en) - web scraping this list will give me a list of edible trees for filtering City of Pittsburgh Trees into "edible" and "not edible"
